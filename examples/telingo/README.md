# Telingo examples

In this folder, you can find the CNL specification of some problems with the corresponding translation generated by CNL2TEL.
In order to use CNL2TEL, you have to:
- Install the tool:
`pip install cnl2asp`
- Run the tool: \
`cnl2asp input_file [output_file]` \
 You can also run cnl2tel from source using the following command: \
`python3 src/main.py input_file [output_file]`

If output_file is not provided, the output is printed in stdout.

Moreover, in the experiments folder you can find the [telingo](https://github.com/potassco/telingo) output obtained by running the CNL2TEL generated encodings and the orginal human written encodings taken from the [telingo](https://github.com/potassco/telingo/tree/master/examples)'s repository.
