# Telingo examples

In this folder, you can find the CNL specification of some problems with the corresponding translation generated by CNL2TEL.
Moreover, in the experiments folder you can find the [telingo](https://github.com/potassco/telingo) output obtained by running the CNL2TEL generated encodings and the orginal human written encodings taken from the [telingo](https://github.com/potassco/telingo/tree/master/examples)'s repository.
