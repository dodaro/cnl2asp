A disk is identified by an id.
A peg is identified by an id.
A goal is identified by a disk, and by a peg.

Every disk X can be on exactly 1 peg 1, where X is greater than 0.

The following propositions always apply:
There is a disk with id 0.
There is a disk with id 1.
There is a disk with id 3.
There is a disk with id 2.

There is a peg with id 1.
There is a peg with id 2.
There is a peg with id 3.

There is a goal with disk id 3, with peg 3.
There is a goal with disk id 2, with peg 3.
There is a goal with disk id 1, with peg 3.

The following propositions always apply except in the initial state:
Whenever there is a disk D, then D can be moved to a peg.
It is required that the number of disks that are moved to a peg is equal to 1.

A disk D is on a peg P when disk D is moved to peg P.
A disk D is on a peg P when disk D is previously on peg P and also disk D is not moved to.

A disk X is blocked in peg P when disk D is previously on peg P, where X is equal to D-1.
A disk X is blocked in peg P when disk D is blocked in peg P, where X is equal to D-1.

It is prohibited that a disk D is moved to a peg P, when a disk X is blocked in peg P, where X is equal to D-1.
It is prohibited that a disk D is moved to a peg P1, when disk D is previously on peg P2 and also disk D is blocked in peg P2.

The following propositions apply in the final state:
It is prohibited that disk D is not on peg P, whenever there is a goal with disk id D, with peg id P.
