A node is identified by an id, and by a weight.
An edge is identified by a first node id, and by a second node id.
A set is identified by an id.

There is a node with id 1, with weight 1.
There is a node with id 2, with weight 1.
There is a node with id 3, with weight 1.
There is a node with id 4, with weight 1.
There is a node with id 5, with weight 4.

There is a set with id 1.
There is a set with id 2.

There is an edge with first node id equal to 1, with second node id equal to 2.
There is an edge with first node id equal to 1, with second node id equal to 3.
There is an edge with first node id equal to 4, with second node id equal to 5.

Whenever there is a node N, then N can be assigned to exactly 1 set.

It is prohibited that a node with id N1 is assigned to a set S1
and also a node with id N2 is assigned to S1,
whenever there is an edge with first node id N1, with second node id N2.

It is required that the number of node id that are assigned to a set S1
is greater than
the number of node id that are assigned to a set S2, where S1 is equal to 1 and S2 is equal to 2.

It is required that the total of weights that are assigned to a set S2
is greater than or equal to
the total of weights that are assigned to a set S1, where S1 is equal to 1 and S2 is equal to 2.
