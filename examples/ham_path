A node goes from 1 to 5.

Node 1 is connected to node X, where X is one of 2, 3.
Node 2 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 4.
Node 3 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 4.
Node 4 is connected to node X, where X is one of 3, 5.
Node 5 is connected to node X, where X is one of 3, 4.

start is a constant equal to 1.

Every node X can have a path to a node connected to node X.
It is required that the number of nodes where node X has a path to is equal to 1.
It is required that the number of nodes that have a path to node X is equal to 1.

Node Y is reachable when node X is reachable and also node X has a path to node Y.
Node start is reachable.

It is required that every node is reachable.
