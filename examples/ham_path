A path is identified by a first node, by a second node.
A node goes from 1 to 5.

Node 1 is connected to node X, where X is one of 2, 3.
Node 2 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 4.
Node 3 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 4.
Node 4 is connected to node X, where X is one of 3, 5.
Node 5 is connected to node X, where X is one of 3, 4.

start is a constant equal to 1.

Every node X can have a path with first node X, with second node Y to a node Y connected to node X.
It is required that the number of nodes where node X has a path with first node X, with second node Y to node Y is equal to 1.
It is required that the number of nodes where node Y has a path with first node X, with second node Y to node X is equal to 1.


Node start is reachable.
Node Y is reachable when node X is reachable and also node X has a path with first node X, with second node Y to node Y.

It is required that every node is reachable.
