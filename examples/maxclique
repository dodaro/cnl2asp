A node goes from 1 to 5.
Node 1 is connected to node X, where X is one of 2, 3.
Node 2 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 3, 4, 5.
Node 3 is connected to node X, where X is one of 1, 2, 4, 5.
Node 4 is connected to node X, where X is one of 2, 3, 5.
Node 5 is connected to node X, where X is one of 2, 3, 4.
Every node can be chosen. 
It is required that when node X is not connected to node Y then node X is not chosen and also node Y is not chosen, where X is different from Y.
It is preferred with high priority that the number of nodes that are chosen is maximized.
