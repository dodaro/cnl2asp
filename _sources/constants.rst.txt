Constants definition
============================

In order to define a constant the following statement is accepted:

.. code-block:: text

    CONSTANT -> NAME "is a constant" ("equal to" STRING)?

where *NAME* is a string that identifies the constant. Constants can be initialized with a value or not.
In case you want to initialize the constant, include the second part :code:`("equal to" STRING)?`. Values can be strings or numbers.

Examples:

.. code-block:: text

    minKelvinTemperature is a constant equal to 0.
    acceptableTemperature is a constant.
    

-----------------------------
Corresponding ASP:
-----------------------------

The first sentence of the previous example is translated into:

.. code-block::

    #const minKelvinTemperature = 0.

In both cases, in the translation of the CNL into ASP, the constants are maintained with their name in the ASP encoding, e.g. in atoms' fields, aggregates...
